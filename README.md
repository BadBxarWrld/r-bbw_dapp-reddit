## Branching Strategy

[TheAverageNewishCoder](https://github.com/TheAverageNewishCoder) follows a simple branching model:
1. **main** – The primary subreddit feature (Crypto Registration)
2. **additional subreddit feature** – Each new feature that is added to the subreddit, r/BBW_Dapp is developed on a separate branch.  
   For example, if you’re adding a new subreddit feature, create a branch named `feature/subreddit` and work there.

When a feature is complete, DO NOT open a pull request to merge the changes back into `main`. Unless it's directly relevant to the Crypto Registration feature. All other requests may be ignored.
